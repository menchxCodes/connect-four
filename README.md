# Connect Four in Ruby
A terminal-version of the connect-four game made in Ruby.

This was an [Odin Project assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-connect-four). The goal of this assignment was to get familiar with Test Driven Development (TDD). It helped me get used to rspec syntax and test-writing. It was hard not to jump ahead and write code before writing the tests, and while a TDD approach might not always be suitable, it was fun to change my flow and write tests and then think about what code I should write to satisfy the spec file.
